% Calibration file for RTX6001 audio analyser (ADC, input at “31.6V” setting)
%
% NOTE: the voltage labels on the RTX6001 front panel refer RMS values of a sine signal. Multiply the front panel labels by sqrt(2) to obtain the peak voltage.
% General information:
name = RTX6001 31.6-V INPUT
type = ADC
sensitivity = 0.022377 1/V % 2.2377%-FS digital output corresponds to 1 Volt at ADC input (voltage measured between POS and NEG pins). NOTE: clipping may occur before reaching 100% ADC output depending on signal symmetry between POS and NEG pins.

% Frequency response is very flat, so no transfer function data is included here.
