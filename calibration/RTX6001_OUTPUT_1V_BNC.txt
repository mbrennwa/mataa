% Calibration file for RTX6001 audio analyser (DAC, BNC output at “1V” setting)
%
% NOTE: the voltage labels on the RTX6001 front panel refer to RMS values of a sine signal. Multiply the front panel labels by sqrt(2) to obtain the peak voltage.
%
% General information:name = RTX6001 1-V BNC OUTPUT
type = DACsensitivity = 0.70711 V % 100% full scale input to DAC gives 0.70711 V at BNC output
% Frequency response is very flat, so no transfer function data is included here.
