% function [s,t] = mataa_signal_crop (s,t,t_start,t_end);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% This function crops out the part of the signal s(t) in the range t = t_start...t_end
% 
% INPUT:
% s: signal samples
% t: time coordinates of impulse response samples (vector, in seconds), or, alternatively, the sampling frequency of s(t) (scalar, in Hz)
%
% OUPTUT:
% s: signal samples of cropped signal
% t: time coordinates of cropped signal (in seconds)
