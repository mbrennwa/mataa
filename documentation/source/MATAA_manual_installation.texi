Before digging in, I believe the following note is in order: installing MATAA and MATLAB/Octave may be difficult for those who are not experienced computer buffs. If you need help, ask a wizard. If you don't have a wizard at hand, try asking me at @email{@value{CONTACT-EMAIL}}.

@section MATLAB/Octave
To run MATAA, you need to install either MATLAB or Octave. I leave it up to you to decide on either of those. You can also install both MATLAB and Octave, they can peacefully co-exist on the same computer. MATLAB is an expensive commercial product, and you get what you pay for (see @uref{http://www.mathworks.com} for details). In contrast, Octave is free software, but you still get a lot from it (more than enough for MATAA), see @uref{http://www.octave.org} for details. Furthermore, there is a very helpful mailing list where you can get help and assistance with Octave, see @uref{http://www.octave.org/help}. Depending on your computer platform and operating system, the installation of MATLAB or Octave will be different. Please follow the instructions that come with MATLAB/Octave.

If you decide to run MATAA using Octave, I highly recommend to use Octave 3.0 or later. While earlier MATAA versions were able to run on Octave 2.1 or 2.9, version 3.0 incorporates a large part of Matlab's handle-graphics system. To simplifiy further development of MATAA on both Octave and Matlab, I therefore decided to drop support for the older gnuplot-oriented graphics system in Octave. The plotting routines of current versions of MATAA therefore rely on Octave 3.0 or later.

@cindex Default path (MATLAB/Octave)

@cindex Path, default (MATLAB/Octave)
I recommend to keep all your MATLAB/Octave code and packages in one directory (which may of course contain several subdirectories). This greatly helps MATLAB/Octave to find your files. For MATLAB, the default path for this is @file{~/MATLAB} (where @file{~} indicates your home directory). For Octave, there is no default (I believe), but I recommend to use either @file{~/Octave/} or, if you have both MATLAB and Octave installed and want to keep the MATLAB/Octave files in the same directory, @file{~/MATLAB/}.

@section MATAA
First of all, download MATAA. There are two possiblities:

@itemize

@item Download a recent package file from  @uref{@value{MATAA-URL}} and expand it if your internet browser or computer didn't do so already. If you later need to update to a more current version, download the most current package file, expand it and replace your previous version with the new one.
@item Download the most current version using subversion with the following command:@*
@command{svn checkout https://mataa.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mataa}@*
If you later need to update to the current version, use the following command:@*
@command{svn update}
@end itemize

You should now have a directory @file{mataa} containing several sub-directories. Make sure @file{mataa} (and its subdirectories) is located in your default MATLAB/Octave path, which is assumed to be @file{~/MATLAB/} from now on (see @ref{Installing MATLAB/Octave}). Your MATAA setup should now look like this (in alphabetical order):
@itemize

@cindex Default path (MATAA)
@cindex MATAA default paths
@cindex Path, default (MATAA)

@item @file{~/MATLAB/mataa/documentation/}: This directory contains the MATAA documentation and manual in various formats.

@cindex TestTone
@cindex TestDevices

@item @file{~/.mataa_settings.mat}: This file is used to store the `preferences' of MATAA (e.g. the color to be used for data plotting). Don't worry if this file is missing---MATAA will create it for you.

@end itemize

In addition to these files and paths, you might consider to create an additional path to keep your custom MATAA scripts. I highly recommend to keep this path outside the main MATAA path. Otherwise it will be difficult to upgrade to a newer version of MATAA and you increase the risk of accidentally loosing your custom files during the upgrade process. For instance, I keep my custom MATAA scripts in @file{~/MATLAB/mataa_user_scripts/}.

@cindex Startup file, MATLAB/Octave
@cindex MATLAB, startup file
@cindex Octave, startup file
If everything set up as outlined above, you are ready to use MATAA from within MATLAB/Octave. However, MATLAB/Octave will (most propably) not find the MATAA files. To tell MATLAB/Octave where the MATAA files are, you can use the @command{addpath}Ê (with older versions of Octave, you may have to use @command{path}Êinstead). To automate this task, I recommend to put the necessary commands into the so-called startup file of MATLAB/Octave. This file is executed by MATLAB/Octave everytime MATLAB/Octave is started. You can edit the startup file, which is an ASCII text file, using your preferred text editor:

@itemize
@item For MATLAB, the startup file is @file{~/MATLAB/startup.m}
@item For Octave, the startup file is @file{~/.octaverc} (note the dot in the file name)
@end itemize

For example, assume you have installed MATAA to @file{~/MATLAB/mataa/}. Add the following lines to the end of this file:

@example
addpath ("~/MATLAB/mataa/mataa_tools");
addpath ("~/MATLAB/mataa/mataa_scripts");
addpath ("~/MATLAB/mataa/test_signals");
@end example

If you created a directory @file{~/MATLAB/mataa_user_scripts/} to store your custom MATAA stuff, you may add the following line to let MATLAB/Octave know about this::

@example
addpath ("~/MATLAB/mataa_user_scripts");
@end example

If the path to your MATAA files contains spaces, you will need to add a backslash in front of the space(s). Otherwise MATLAB/Octave will not recognize the space(s) and the @command{path} commands will fail. For example, if your MATAA files are in @file{~/My Octave files/mataa}, the above lines would read @command{addpath ("~/My\ Octave\ files/mataa/mataa_tools/");}, etc.

Also, it is not recommended to install the MATAA files (or any of your personal MATLAB/Octave files) to the path where the MATLAB/Octave program is installed. Once you update your MATLAB/Octave software to a later version, the previous program files may be deleted, and hence your MATAA (or other personal MATLAB/Octave files) will be deleted, too.

@c If you are running Octave on Mac OS X, you may also want to tweak the behaviour of X11 a bit. If you want to use Octave with Terminal.app rather than the X11 terminal, you will need to tell the terminal where to send X11 plotting commands. If you're using bash with Terminal.app (the default shell on Mac OS X 10.3 and later), create a file @file{.profile}Êin your home directory (if it's not already there) and add the command @command{[[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && export DISPLAY=":0.0"} to it in order to redirect the plotting commands to X11. This command will be executed the next time bash is started and reads the @file{.profile}Êfile. Also, you may want to tell X11.app to automatically start when you log in to the computer.

@section Hardware Setup
The way your sound hardware (soundcard or audio interface) needs to be set up for use with MATAA will depend on its features, on your computer platform, and on the type of measurement you want to make. Furthermore, additional devices (e.g. amplifiers, filters, microphones, etc.) may be needed for certain measurements. Hence, the hardware setup will vary with the type of measurement and the specifics your equipment. This manual therefore aims to provide rather general advice and background on what to watch out for.

That said, you should also remember that a measurement can only be as good as the audio hardware you use!

@cindex Measurement setup
@cindex Setup, measurement
@subsection The Building Blocks of the Measurement Setup
@cindex Signal path
@cindex Test signal path
@cindex Path, test signal
The basic procedure followed during a MATAA measurement is that MATAA feeds a test signal to the soundcard, which is connected to the DUT. The response of the DUT to this test signal is recorded by the soundcard. The response signal is then loaded back into MATAA for further analysis.

@end float

@ref{fig:measurement_setup} shows that the measurement setup comprises several building blocks. Depending on the type of measurement and setup, some (or most) of these building blocks are obsolete. In @ref{fig:measurement_setup}, the test signal travels through the following blocks:

@cindex Sound hardware setup
@cindex Hardware setup, sound
@cindex Setup, sound hardware
@itemize

@item The audio output of the soundcard. The the sound hardware is usually set up via the operating system. The output level of the soundcard should be set as high as possible to maximise the signal/noise ratio (SNR). Apart from thatz, the quality of the test signal will depend on the quality of the soundcard (e.g. the D/A converter). Today, most soundcards support sampling rates of 44.1 kHz and bit depths of 16 bits (CD quality), which is fine for many types of measurements. Many soundcards allow sampling rates of 96 kHz or even 192 kHz and sampling depths of 24 bits, therefore providing more headroom with respect to SNR and the upper frequency limit. In some applications (e.g. for low-frequency analyses utilising long test signals), however, low sampling rates are preferable to minimise memory and computing time. Most soundcards allow sampling frequencies as low as 8 kHz. Another aspect of the souncard output is the output impedance and output power. The output impedance should be much lower than the input impedance of the next stage. While most soundcards can easily drive high-impedance headphones, the output impedance may be too high and the output power too low to directly drive a loudspeaker or other low-impedance DUT.

@item A buffer or amplifier (A in @ref{fig:measurement_setup}). Depending on the DUT, you will need a buffer or amplifier to match the impedance and power loevel to the DUT.

@item The device under test (DUT). In principle, this can be anything accepting an electrical sound at its input. Typical MATAA applications include loudspeakers and speaker crossover filters, as well as active devices such as active filters or amplifiers.

@item A sensor (B in @ref{fig:measurement_setup}) to convert the output signal of the DUT to an electrical signal. For instance, this sensor may be a microphone or an accelerometer (e.g. for loudspeaker testing). If the output of the DUT is electrical (e.g. in case of a filter circuit or an amplifier), the DUT's output should be terminated by a resistor, which can be considered to act as a sensor. This resistor should have the same value as the impedance of the device that would otherwise be connected to the output of the DUT. For testing loudspeaker crossover filters, consider connecting the filter output to the speaker driver(s) rather than a resistor, because the behaviour of the filter may depend on the complex impedance of the driver(s). If the signal voltage from the sensor (or the DUT) is higher than the maximum voltage of the next stage, you will need to attenuate the signal, e.g. using a voltage divider. In some cases (e.g. to analyse high-voltage signals in tube amplifiers), I strongly recommend to add further over-voltage protection to avoid destroying anything!

@item A buffer or amplifier (C in @ref{fig:measurement_setup}) to match the signal amplitude and impedance level of the DUT response to the input of the soundcard. If the DUT's respons was recorded with a microphone, this will be a microphone amplifier. In many other cases, this buffer/amplifier can be omitted, provided the output impedance of the previous stage (the sensor) is much lower than the input impedance of the next stage.

@cindex Anti-aliasing filter
@cindex Filter, anti-aliasing
@item The anti-aliasing filter (D in @ref{fig:measurement_setup}) removes high-frequency components from the DUT's response signal. If the the DUT response contains signal components with frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling frequency) of the sound input's analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, these signal components will be aliased to lower frequencies during A/D conversion. This signal `contamination' can be avoided (or at least constrained) by removing the signal components higher than the Nyquist frequency @emph{before}ÊA/D conversion. Many soundcards have a built-in anti-aliasing filter with a cut-off frequency that is automatically adjusted to the sampling rate. You can check for the presence of an anti-aliasing filter by applying sine signals with frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency (e.g. using an analog signal generator). Then check the digitized signal for alias signals in the frequency range below the Nyquist frequency. Furhter, if the signal from the DUT is (virtually) free of frequencies higher then the Nyquist frequency, you can omit the anti-aliasing filter. Vice versa, you can omit the anti-aliasing filter, if the soundcard samples the test signal with a sampling rate of at least twice the highest frequency contained in the test signal. For instance, loudspeakers and test microphones rarely extend to frequencies higher than 40 kHz. Thus, if your soundcard allows setting the sampling rate to 80 kHz or higher (e.g. 96 kHz or 192 kHz), you can omit the anti-aliasing filter by using a sampling rate of at least 80 kHz.

@item The Soundcard audio input: Here, the same applies as with the audio input, with a few exceptions. Firstly, a high input impedance is preferable so that the previous stage can easily drive the audio input. Secondly, the sensitivity of the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter should be set as high as possible (to maximise SNR), but not too high (to avoid clipping of the signal).

@subsection Soundcard setup, TestTone, and TestDevices
MATAA talks to the soundcard using the TestTone and TestDevices programs (which are part of the MATAA package, see @ref{Installing MATAA}). If your computer has more than one device for sound input or output, MATAA uses the default device set for your computer.

A few notes:
@itemize

@item The Windows versions of TestTone and TestDevices only work with ASIO drivers (WMME and DirectSound are not supported). If your soundcard did not come with an ASIO driver, check out ASIO4ALL (@uref{http://www.asio4all.com}). The Windows binaries were compiled by Shu Sang (@email{sangshu@@hotmail.com}) -- thank you Shu! Please note that Shu used Microsoft Visual Studio to compile TestTone and TestDevices. Therefore, if you experience problems with sound input or output, you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86) to make TestTone and TestDevices work properly. You can download the package here:
@uref{http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=200B2FD9-AE1A-4A14-984D-389C36F85647&displaylang=en} (thanks to Gabe for this hint!).

@item The Mac OS X versions of TestTone and TestDevices rely on CoreAudio, Apples application programming interface for sound on Mac OS X. CoreAudio provides automatic sample-rate conversion. It is therefore possible to use sample rates with MATAA that are not directly supported by the hardware.

@item At the moment, no precompiled binary versions of TestTone and TestDevices are available for Linux. You can, however, compile your own binaries using the source code included in the MATAA distribution (see @ref{Compiling TestTone and TestDevices on Linux}).

@subsection Compiling TestTone and TestDevices on Linux
The data exchange between MATAA and the sound card is handled by two programs, TestTone and TestDevices. While there are precompiled binaries for Mac OS X and Windows, these two programs need to be compiled first if you want to use the sound card with Linux. While several users sucessfully compiled TestTone and TestDevices on Linux, I can't provide comprehensive step-by-step instructions that will work on all Linux distributions. However, the general procedure is as follows:
@itemize

@item Install PortAudio. Some Linux distributions provide package for easy installation. Otherwise, you can download a recent version of PortAudio from @uref{http://portaudio.com} and install it following the instructions on this website.

@item Compile the source code (@file{TestTonePA19.c} and @file{TestDevicesPA19.c} in @file{.../mataa/TestTone/source/} using a C comiler, e.g. @command{gcc}.

@item Move the binaries to @file{.../mataa/TestTone/PCLINUX/TestTonePA19} and @file{.../mataa/TestTone/PCLINUX/TestDevicesPA19}.

@anchor{Sound channel allocation}
@cindex Channel allocation
@cindex Soundcard channel allocation
@cindex Allocation of soundcard channels
@cindex DUT channel
@cindex REF channel
@subsection Sound channel allocation
Most soundcards have at least two sound channels for stereo sound. While many measurements can be made using only one channel, there are a few cases where the second channel is needed to record a reference signal (e.g. impedance measurements, @ref{Impedance measurement}). In most other cases, using the second channel to record a calibration signal will allow you to correct for  artifacts that may be introduced by the test equipment, which will improve the precision and the quality of the measurement.

While @ref{fig:measurement_setup}Êshows the path of the test signal to and from the DUT, it does not show the path reference signal. The reference-signal path will depend strongly on the type of measurement and the test equipment used. @ref{fig:ref_signal_paths} is an attempt to illustrate some typical examples.

@float Figure,fig:ref_signal_paths
@iftex
@image{figures/ref_signal_paths,6in,,reference signal paths}
@end iftex

@image{figures/ref_signal_paths,,,reference signal paths}

@caption{Some examples of how to use the second sound channel ('REF') of a stereo soundcard. A: both the power amplifier and the microphone amplifier are mono: wire the REF output directly to the REF input, B: the power amplifier has two (stereo) channels, but the microphone amplifier is mono: use the second channel of the power amplifier to calibrate for its characteristics, C: both the power amplifier and the microphone amplifier are stereo: use the second channel of the power amplifier and the microphone amplifier to calibrate for the characteristics of both amplifiers.}
@end float


By default, MATAA uses the left channel to record the test signal from the DUT, and the right channel to record the reference signal. If your soundcard uses 3.5 mm jacks, the DUT channel (left) should be on the tip of the 3.5 mm jack. The reference channel (right) should be on the ring in the middle of the jack. The ground (common to both channels) is on the contact closest to the body of the jack @ref{fig:jack}. If the left and right channels are revesed on the connectors of your soundcard, you can adjust the channel allocation using the @command{mataa_settings} command.

@anchor{Interchannel delay}
@cindex Interchannel delay
@cindex Delay, interchannel (soundcard)
@cindex Soundcard interchannel delay
@subsection Interchannel delay
With some (lesser) soundcards, the data recorded in one channel may be offset in time with respect to the other up to to several tens of microseconds. This effect is called ``interchannel delay''. Interchannel delay can result in wrong results from impedance measurements using the sine-sweep method as described in ``MATAA: A Free Computer-Based Audio Analysis System'' (article in audioXpress (7), 2007).

Therefore, interchannel delay must be removed from the measured data before calculating impedance function from the data. The @command{mataa_measure_impedance} command, which automates impedance measurement using the mentioned sine-sweep method, takes care of interchannel delay by shifting the measured data in time. The information on the amount of interchannel delay is taken from the MATAA settings file (the @command{interchannel_delay} field specifies the interchannel delay in seconds). By default, the interchannel delay is set to zero. You can adjust this value using the @command{mataa_settings} command (see @ref{mataa_settings}). For instance, with a soundcard exhibiting an interchannel delay of 17 microseconds, the interchannel delay parameter would be set by:

@example
mataa_settings('interchannel_delay',17E-6);
@end example

To test if your soundcard exhibits interchannel delay, it is best to measure the impedance of a resistor with a purely ohmic impedance (i.e. with constant resistance for all frequencies) using the method described in ``MATAA: A Free Computer-Based Audio Analysis System'' (article in audioXpress (7), 2007). If this measurement gives a flat impedance reading, your soundcard is not affected by interchannel delay (or the interchannel delay is already adjusted properly in the MATAA settings). Otherwise, you need to adjust the interchannel delay setting until you get a flat impedance reading.

@node Testing the Installation
@section Testing the Installation
To test your software installation, first start MATLAB or Octave. Then, type @command{mataa_selftest} to the MATLAB/Octave command prompt to run a MATAA self-test. @command{mataa_selftest} is a MATAA script in @file{.../mataa/mataa_scripts/} that runs several tests, that will display various messages on the success of the tests. Some tests may fail, but that does not necessarily mean that your MATAA installation is broken. If in doubt, carefully read the error or warning messages. If still in doubt, contact me at @email{@value{CONTACT-EMAIL}}.

The self-test script also includes a test of the hardware for sound input and output. Details on the setup of the sound hardware are given in @ref{Hardware Setup}. For now, it will suffice to run the self test with the soundcard input(s) connected directly to the output(s).

If MATLAB/Octave cannot find the @command{mataa_selftest} script, this most likely indicates that the script file is not on the search path of MATLAB/Octave. Double check the path settings outlined in @ref{Installing MATAA}. You can also type @command{path} to the MATLAB/Octave prompt to display the current search path.
