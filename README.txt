MATAA (Mat's Audio Analyzer)

MATAA is an extremely flexible and versatile audio analysis system. Similarly to many other computer-based audio analysis systems, MATAA applies a test signal to the device under test and simultaneously records the response signal for subsequent analysis. MATAA uses a computer soundcard to play and record test signals to and from a device under test.

MATAA runs on all sorts of computer platforms because it uses GNU Octave or Matlab (these are powerful number crunching programs which provide a huge toolbox of routines for data analysis and processing). For this reason, MATAA is extremely flexible and easily extendible with custom test signals, data analysis methods, plotting procedures, and scrips to automate measurements.

Further instructions on how to install and use MATAA are available in the manual provided with MATAA.
